  <!-- Core Idea Section -->

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">The Core Idea</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        In show jumping, the way a rider talks can change everything. A horse can feel tension, hesitation, belief.
        Your body works the same way. When your inner voice is steady, you perform at your peak.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">
        Jump Higher turns these rider insights into short "encouragement tapes" which will retrain your inner dialogue.
        The recording mirrors the rhythm of a jump: <strong>Approach. Take off. Land. Breathe.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">
        It's performance language, not therapy. Professional jumpers master emotional regulation under pressure. They can't fake confidence. The horse knows.

      <p class="section-text" style="font-style: italic; font-size: 22px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
        "Come on now. You've got this. Easy. Eyes up. Stay with me. Beautiful."
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">
        This is the audio that started it all. Recorded from the sidelines during a winning run, you can catch a glimpse of the quiet encouragement. The rider speaks in a calm, steady voice. Not loud motivation or forced positivity.
