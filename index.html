      <p class="section-text">
        Every day, your inner critic holds you back. That voice that says "you can't," "you're not good enough,"
        "why even try?" It's exhausting. It's limiting. And it's time to change the conversation.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">
        Professional horse trainers have known for centuries: the way you speak to a being shapes their performance.
        A confident, encouraging rider brings out the champion in their horse. What if you could do the same for yourself?

      <p class="section-text">
        This recording captures something rare: the quiet, calm encouragement we all need. It's not loud motivation or forced positivity.
        It's the gentle voice of your "inner rider" - steady, patient, confident from a distance.
